🧠 What is Kabadi Wala?
Kabadi Wala is a web platform built using Bolt.dev that connects users with waste collectors and enables efficient, category-based garbage pickup. It also promotes sustainability by offering an eco-point reward system, where users earn points for recycling and can redeem them in an in-app marketplace.

We're also developing a companion mobile app (UI in Figma) featuring a Garbage Report Tool to help governments track cleanliness and waste trends.
